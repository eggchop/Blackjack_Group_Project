# Blackjack (1-week group project)

For our first group project at CodeClan, we decided to build the clasic casino game Blackjack. Our version is a full stack JavaScript application with an Express server and MongoDB database.

## Brief
Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.

## Rules

The project must be built using **only**:

* HTML / CSS
* Javascript
* Express
* MongoDB

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* Jquery
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

## MVP
```diff
+ Two cards can be dealt to both the dealer and the player
+ Hands can be totalled to decide which has the highest value
+ Game displays in browser
```

## Extensions
```diff
+ A player can draw cards.
+ The model declares “Bust” if the hand is over 21.
+ A player draws multiple cards until bust or “Hit” is clicked.
+ Dealer takes a turn. Will draw until at least 17 or is bust.
+ Have a purse available to the player.
+ Allow the player to place bets.
+ Have the rules listed.
+ Bets and hands are totalled.
+ Buttons disabled until the appropriate point.
```
## Next Steps - what the group would liked to have achieved given more time
```diff
- Remember a player and recall their purse.
- Allow for multiple players.
- Allow players to split their hand.
```
